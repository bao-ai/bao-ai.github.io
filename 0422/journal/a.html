		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
		<ul>Passing cars</ul>
		<ul>When you can't see,</ul>
		<ul>May get you, A glimpse, </ul>
		<ul>Of eternity.</ul>
		<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

		<p>My first day of the trip!</p>
		<strong>I can't believe I finally goteverything packed and ready to go.</strong>
		<p> Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
		<li>cellphone</li>
		<li>iPod</li>
		<li>digital camera</li>
		<li>and a protein bar</li>
		<p>Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</p>
